        <h2>About The Project</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
        <p>This project is a web application designed to predict traffic situations based on real-time vehicle count data. It leverages a machine learning model to classify traffic into four categories: <strong>Low, Normal, High, and Heavy</strong>.</p>
        
        <h4>Objective</h4>
        <p>The main goal is to provide a tool for traffic analysis and prediction, which can help in traffic management and planning. By inputting the number of different vehicles, users can get an instant prediction of the traffic condition.</p>
        
        <h4>Technology Stack</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Flask (Python)</li>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Scikit-learn</li>
            <li><strong>Data Handling:</strong> Pandas</li>
            <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML, Bootstrap CSS</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Model</h4>
        <p>The prediction is powered by a <strong>Random Forest Classifier</strong>, a robust ensemble learning method. It was trained on the <code>TrafficTwoMonth.csv</code> dataset, which contains historical data on vehicle counts and their corresponding traffic situations.</p>
